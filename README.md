 ## 💡 Tips & Strategies
 
 ### Beginner Tips
 1. **Claim Daily Reward First**
    - Always claim your 500 SKYE daily pack
    - Available 3 seconds after game loads
 
 2. **Don't Rush Planes**
    - Start with the default 50 planes
    - Only add more when you have spare SKYE
    - Each plane costs 10 SKYE (50 SKYE for 5 planes)
 
 3. **Complete Missions**
    - Easy source of bonus SKYE
    - Just play naturally to complete most missions
 
 ### Intermediate Strategies
 1. **Invest in Upgrades Early**
    - Permanent benefits compound over time
    - Plane Efficiency gives best ROI early
 
 2. **Use Speed Boosts Wisely**
    - Don't waste speed boosts when AFK
    - Best used during active play sessions
    - 5x speed is expensive but very efficient
 
 3. **Lucky Charm Timing**
    - Use during long play sessions (8 hours)
    - Combine with speed boosts for maximum effect
 
 ### Advanced Optimization
 1. **Upgrade Balance**
    - Keep all upgrades within 2-3 levels of each other
    - Balanced upgrades > maxing one upgrade
 
 2. **Plane Management**
    - Optimal plane count: 100-150 for mid-game
    - More planes = higher maintenance cost
    - Selling planes gives instant SKYE for emergencies
 
 3. **Token Banking**
    - Keep 500+ SKYE in reserve
    - Enables flexibility for opportunities
    - Can afford any upgrade or boost when needed
 
 ### Idle Play Strategy
 1. Set speed to 1x (no cost)
 2. Maximize passive income upgrades
 3. Add maximum planes your SKYE allows
 4. Activate Lucky Charm before going AFK
 5. Leave browser tab open
 
 ### Active Play Strategy
 1. Use 3x or 5x speed boosts
 2. Focus on XP Boost upgrades
 3. Complete missions actively
 4. Monitor rewards and claim immediately
